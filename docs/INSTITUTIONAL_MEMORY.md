# Institutional Memory

This document will contain the governance memory infrastructure for Project Genesis — the connective tissue that makes the constitution a living document.

## Status: Stub

Not yet substantive. Three components are planned:

1. **Structural Map** — how all governance layers relate, where authoritative sources live, how amendments propagate
2. **Precedent Archive** — structured storage and retrieval for Constitutional Court rulings, queryable by provision
3. **Constitution Annotated** — provision-by-provision interpretive commentary tracking how each provision's meaning has evolved

**Trigger:** Pre-alpha documentation phase (post-Step 10), or when real governance participants need to navigate the system.

See `MEMORY.md` → "What Remains" for full design rationale.
