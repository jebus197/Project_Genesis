# Project Genesis — Trust Mint Log

The entries below are the constitutional anchoring record of Project Genesis.

Before a single user existed, before a single mission was posted, before any revenue flowed — the rules were set in stone. Each entry is a cryptographic proof, permanently embedded in Ethereum, that the constitution existed in an exact, unalterable form at an exact moment in time.

No other platform has done this. The rules were committed publicly, immutably, and irrevocably — before anyone had a reason to lobby for changes. Nothing can be hidden — from day one, not even by the founder themselves.

Every anchor below is a 0-ETH self-send transaction on Ethereum Sepolia. The SHA-256 hash of the constitution is embedded in the transaction data field. Anyone, at any time, can independently verify that the document they hold matches the hash on-chain. The blockchain serves as a witness — a notary stamp that cannot be forged, altered, or retroactively changed.

  **First Light sustainability model + machine registration enforcement.** The platform can now monitor its own financial viability and automatically transition from demonstration to live operation when conditions are met. Machines can only enter the system through verified human operators.

  **Creator provisions + 50-year founder legacy.** The founder's 2% allocation is constitutionally anchored alongside the dormancy clause: after 50 years of inactivity, all accumulated founder allocation flows to organisations dedicated to using science for human betterment. The rules of the legacy were committed before the legacy began.

  **The first constitutional anchoring.** Trust cannot be bought, sold, exchanged, delegated, rented, inherited, or gifted. Trust can only be earned through verified behaviour and verified outcomes over time. This is the moment the rules became immutable.
